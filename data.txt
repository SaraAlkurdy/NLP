ASCII text and HTML text are human-readable formats. Text often comes in binary
formats—such as PDF and MSWord—that can only be opened using specialized soft-ware. Third-party libraries such as pypdf and pywin32 provide access to these formats.
Extracting text from multicolumn documents is particularly challenging. For one-off
conversion of a few documents, it is simpler to open the document with a suitable
application , then save it as text to your local drive, and access it as described below. If
the document is already on the Web , you can enter its URL in Google’s search box.
The search result often includes a link to an HTML version of the document, which
you can save as text.
